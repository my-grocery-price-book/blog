When working with a team of frontend developers/designers or working by yourself, having a components list of what css
is available to you can be a real time saver. I don't know how much longer I would of taken without bootstraps 
components. There is a small rails gem https://github.com/richarcher/component_library that allows you to build your
own component library. I am also using it to see my reactjs components. Feel free to check it out at
