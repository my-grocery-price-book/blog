So doing this project during my free time has been quite a challenge for me so farREADMORE
I usually have about 7 to 10 hours a week in the evenings to work on developing.
Usually I use this time to either mess around with a new technology or sometimes I find 
myself still doing work. 

I have been busy this week refactoring the grocery api to use the 
[roda](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda) which has turned into a bigger refactor than
I thought it would be (due to having to do the type casting myself). I must say I
do feel much better the way the code looks now and I do feel like the code is more 
under my control but from the outside I have not really added anything.

I realise I am doing these kinds of refactoring a bit early (putting the perfect project on ice) 
and I am more likely at the point where I have to let the technical debt build up until I have 
a working product. Who knows I might never change it and never have to pay back that technical debt?

I am hoping to keep these kind of detours under control by taking some advice from a 
[stackexchange answer](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/76877) and focus on getting
a working project that is usable.

That all said, don't forget to check out [roda](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda). 
Janko MarohniÄ‡ [post](http://twin.github.io/introduction-to-roda/) is a nice intro.
