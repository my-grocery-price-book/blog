So what am i trying to accomplish is building a online price book you can use for your grocery shopping READMORE
If you don't know what a Price Book is I suggest you read [Wikipedia Definetion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_book)
and Melanie Pinola's blog article on [How to Save the Most Money on Your Grocery Budget with a Price Book](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-save-the-most-money-on-your-grocery-budget-with-1518202640)

Below I have a flow-chart (built with [draw.io](http://www.draw.io/)) that shows you what a grocery price booker

The Yellow blocks are what all shoppers have to do while the Red blocks show what price bookers do in addition.
These very Red blocks make keeping a price book a serious discipline. So basically the goal of the WIP 
[my-grocery-price-book](http://www.my-grocery-price-book.co.za) is to make keeping a price book less labour
intensive and hopefully using crowd sourcing to make it ever easier to maintain and start a grocery price book.

Hopefully this has set the stage...
