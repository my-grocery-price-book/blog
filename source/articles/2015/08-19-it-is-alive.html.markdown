So the Blog is alive and kicking and I will be blogging here 
about the journey of the grocery price book app I am building.READMORE

I have finally settled on what tools I'll be using to write this blog, thanks to motivation from 
Michael Bleigh on the [Divshot blog](https://divshot.com/blog/hosting/dont-host-static-sites-on-heroku/)

I found this awesome ruby gem called [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) and after following Matthew Crist 
[blog post](https://hondo.wtf/2015/01/05/how-to-host-a-middleman-blog-on-divshot) to get me initially setup, 
I [bootstrapped](http://getbootstrap.com) it and wrote this first article.

I will write a follow up article with a focus on what I am trying to accomplish.

My thoughts and discoveries around this process have finally found a place to live on the internet of things.
